the report!

### How to build and customized the team report

The elements of course engagement we're currently looking at for this report are: 

1) summarizing video statistics by topic (like average length or average number 
of viewers)
2) a model for predicting engagement based on video length
3) a list of the top 5 and bottom 5 most popular videos
4) correlation between length of video and engagement

The reader will be able to pick and choose using the parameters to see which 
elements they would like to see: all, none, or some.
